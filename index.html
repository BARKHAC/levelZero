    hey this is an example repo, hope it works!
    I have studied E&TC engineering , I currently work as a Junior Engineer.
    I have some experience in Robotics and IoT , having created the following projects:
    1) Urban Hydrponic farming setup for Rural Areas
    2) Autonomous Algo Design for a USV
    Besides these I like learning the wonderful things Python allows us to do,such as webscraping.
