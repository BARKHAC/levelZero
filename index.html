    hey this is an example repo, hope it works!
    <p>I have studied E&TC engineering , I currently work as a Junior Engineer.</p>
    <p>I have some experience in Robotics and IoT , having created the following projects:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Urban Hydrponic farming setup for Rural Areas</li>
        <li>Autonomous Algo Design for a USV</li>
    </ol>

    Besides these I like learning the wonderful things Python allows us to do,such as webscraping.
